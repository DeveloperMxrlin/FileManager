# FileManager

File Manager is a Spigot plugin, made for server owners, to not have the need to edit their files, by opening the file, editing, and then restarting the server. With FileManager this is done ingame! You can edit your entries all ingame, and the saving is done automatically! With your agreement the plugin even searches for the entries and replaces them in the working Plugin! No need to restart the server or anything.
